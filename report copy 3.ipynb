    "# Stock Forecasting with the SARIMA Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Machine Learning Model should be added to your company's stock forecasting toolkit because it offers several advantages that can significantly improve forecasting accuracy. The SARIMA model is suitable when dealing with time-series data, like stock data, that exhibit both trend and seasonality. Our SARIMA model has demonstrated high accuracy (~96%). By incorporating SARIMA, you can enhance forecast precision, uncover key seasonal insights, and improve decision-making for better investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The SARIMA Model provides a robust framework for predicting stock prices and is a strong complement to the existing machine learning models used by stock market analysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we applied the SARIMA model to predict stock prices for companies Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). The goal was to assess the effectiveness of SARIMA in capturing seasonal patterns and underlying trends in stock price movements. We evaluated multiple time ranges of historical data (from 2015 to 2024) and found that using the most recent data (2021) yielded the most accurate predictions, with a forecast accuracy of ~96%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**SARIMA: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of the SARIMA model include:\n",
    "* S (Seasonal): Includes seasonal autoregressive (SAR), seasonal differencing (SI), and seasonal moving average (SMA) terms to account for recurring patterns or cycles at specific intervals (e.g., yearly, quarterly).\n",
    "\n",
    "* AR (AutoRegressive): Models the relationship between an observation and a specified number of lagged observations.\n",
    "* I (Integrated): Differencing the series to make it stationary (i.e., removing trends). These trends make the data non-stationary, which can lead to unreliable predictions because the model might mistake the trend as part of the pattern rather than just noise.\n",
    "* MA (Moving Average): Models the relationship between an observation and the residual errors from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA's ability to capture the seasonal patterns and cyclic behavior inherent in sequential data, combined with its foundation in statistical time series analysis principles, enhances the credibility of stock forecasting processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's interpretable parameters (S, AR, I, MA structure) provide a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics driving stock price movements. With these parameters, this model is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* notice the seasonal patterns present in the historical data (S component)\n",
    "* highlight the behavior of past observations (AR component)\n",
    "* understand the difference between noise and actual patterns (I component)\n",
    "* model the relationship between the current observation and past forecast errors (residuals) (MA component)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Three Reasons to Use this Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Captures Stock Price Seasonality: SARIMA can model seasonal patterns in stock prices, such as recurring market cycles or quarterly trends, improving forecast accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accounts for Time Dependencies: By using past stock prices (AR) and past forecast errors (MA), SARIMA can effectively capture trends and fluctuations in stock prices over time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provides Interpretability: The model's parameters offer insights into the factors influencing stock price movements, helping analysts understand the underlying dynamics and make informed investment decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note SARIMA's limitation in capturing external factors, such as news events or sudden market shocks, which may affect stock prices but are not directly incorporated into the model. Despite this limitation, SARIMA remains a valuable tool for predicting stock prices based on historical patterns and internal data dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "While SARIMA is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, there are several reasons why it might not be widely used by everyone, especially in stock forecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity and Tuning: SARIMA requires careful parameter tuning, which can be time-consuming and technical.\n",
    "2. Assumes Stationarity: SARIMA works best with stationary data, but stock prices are often non-stationary and need preprocessing.\n",
    "3. Limited to Historical Data: It only uses past data, ignoring external factors like news or market sentiment, which can influence stock prices.\n",
    "4. Difficulty with Volatility: Stock prices are volatile and unpredictable, making SARIMA less effective for handling sudden market changes.\n",
    "5. Competition from Machine Learning: More flexible machine learning models, like XGBoost or LSTMs, are often preferred for their ability to handle complex data and capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, four time ranges of historical data were evaluated to determine the optimal time lag and time steps to include in the model for three different stocks, AAPL (Apple Inc.), TSLA (Tesla Inc.), and NVDA (NVIDIA Corp.). It is important to test the accuracy of this model with stocks that exhibit all behaviors, which was the reason the three stocks were chosen. Historically, AAPL is known to be a safer stock, TSLA is known to be safe and volatile (fluctuates) and NVDA is known to be commonly volatile. By testing these three stocks, this SARIMA model's performance was analyzed with all ranges of behavior. In turn, improvements were made to the model's parameters to best work for all behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "Historical Data Time Ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 01-01-2015 to 5-31-2024\n",
    "2. 01-01-2017 to 5-31-2024\n",
    "3. 01-01-2029 to 5-31-2024\n",
    "4. 01-01-2021 to 5-31-2024\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tests Used to Determine Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction accuracy was determined using comparison metrics, including R-squared, p-value, RMSE, MSE, MAPE, AIC, and BIC. Please refer to Definition Metric Choices section below for definition of each metric. These metrics were chosen as they are the most common metrics used by financial analysts to analyze model prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, these metrics were specifically utilizated to compare time ranges. Once the optimal time ranges were chosen for each stock, the overall accuracy of the rool was analyzed. The metric with the most weight for determination of accuracy was the MAPE metric (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). The MAPE metric was emphasized more than other metrics due to it being ideal for stationary data. Since the SARIMA model's Integrated component caused the data to undergo differencing, thus making the data stationary, the MAPE metric was determined to be suitable for this application of SARIMA Model with stock forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy Results\n",

    "\n",
    "### A Detailed Analysis of SARIMA's Superiority Over Other Forecasting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Series Prediction vs. Other Machine Learning Tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA excels in time series analysis, making it highly effective for stock price predictions, where the temporal dependencies of historical data play a crucial role. In contrast, other machine learning models may struggle to capture these temporal patterns as effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA is specifically useful due to its interpretable, flexible, and effective for different-sized datasets, offering a reliable method for forecasting complex time series with seasonal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifics of the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SARIMA: Captures seasonality and trends in data, making it robust for stocks with clear cyclical patterns (seasonal patterns), such as AAPL and TSLA. By leveraging its interpretable parameters, SARIMA provides a nuanced understanding of stock price movements and helps identify recurring trends. While it explicitly models seasonal patterns (e.g., yearly cycles), it also accounts for long-term trends, such as gradual increases or decreases in the data. The differencing component of SARIMA helps remove these trends to make the data stationary, enabling more accurate forecasting of underlying patterns, whether they are cyclical or directional.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kevin: Contextual Effectiveness:\n",
    "(Not sure what to put here)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Disadvantages of Other Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**:\n",
    "   - While ARIMA is effective for univariate time series data, it lacks the capability to model seasonal patterns as effectively as SARIMA. SARIMA extends ARIMA by incorporating seasonal components, making it more suitable for datasets with clear seasonal trends, such as stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**:\n",
    "   - GARCH models focus primarily on modeling volatility and are useful for forecasting the variance of returns rather than predicting actual prices. They are not designed for point forecasts of stock prices, limiting their applicability for direct price prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **XGBoost**:\n",
    "   - XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that excels in classification and regression tasks. However, it does not inherently account for the temporal dependencies in time series data. Without careful feature engineering to incorporate time-based features, it may not perform as well for stock price predictions as SARIMA, which directly models these temporal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random Forest**:\n",
    "   - Like XGBoost, Random Forest is a robust model for various prediction tasks but does not leverage the sequential nature of time series data. While it can provide accurate predictions with sufficient data, it typically requires extensive feature engineering to capture the temporal dynamics, which is automatically handled by SARIMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **TBATS (Trigonometric, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA Errors, Trend, and Seasonal Components)**:\n",
    "   - TBATS is designed for complex seasonal patterns, but it can be computationally intensive and may require tuning of multiple parameters. In contrast, SARIMA offers a more straightforward framework for seasonal data without needing as much computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Prophet**:\n",
    "   - Prophet is user-friendly and effective for forecasting time series data with strong seasonal effects and missing values. However, it may not be as robust for datasets with less clear seasonal patterns or when high-frequency forecasting is needed. SARIMA, with its statistical basis, can provide more granular control over the model parameters for precise forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SARIMA vs. Other Models\n",
    "While each of these models has its strengths, they may not capture the intricate seasonal patterns and temporal relationships present in stock price data as effectively as SARIMA. SARIMA’s design specifically caters to time series forecasting, allowing for more reliable predictions in financial contexts, particularly when historical data plays a critical role.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Workflow Summary for AAPL, NVDA, and TSLA Stock Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing historical stock price data from 2021 (AAPL, TSLA) and 2019 (NVDA), the SARIMA model was applied. Key packages such as statsmodels, pandas, and matplotlib were used to generate the most accurate predictions, with results visualized using matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metrics employed include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition Metric choices:\n",
    "The following metrics were considered when determining prediction accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* R-squared (R²):\n",
    "R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. Values range from 0 (no fit) to 1 (perfect fit), with higher values indicating a better model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* P-value:\n",
    "The p-value tests the significance of results in hypothesis testing. A value less than 0.05 suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating a statistically significant result.\n",
    "* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):\n",
    "RMSE measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate better predictive accuracy.\n",
    "* MSE (Mean Squared Error):\n",
    "MSE is the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. Lower values suggest fewer errors and better model performance.\n",
    "* MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):\n",
    "MAPE calculates the average percentage difference between predicted and actual values. It’s used to assess forecasting accuracy, with lower values indicating better performance.\n",
    "* AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):\n",
    "AIC compares models based on fit and complexity, penalizing models with more parameters. A lower AIC suggests a more efficient model.\n",
    "* BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion):\n",
    "BIC is similar to AIC but applies a stronger penalty for additional parameters. It helps identify the simplest, best-fitting model with a lower BIC indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selected Definition of Accuracy:** In this context, accuracy refers to how closely the SARIMA model's predicted values match the actual observed stock prices, as measured by low (less than 10%) MSE, RMSE, and MAPE scores.\n",
